# üéß AirPods Battery CLI

## Overview
A lightweight **command-line tool** for retrieving the battery status of **AirPods** (or other Bluetooth headphones) on macOS. This script fetches connection status and battery levels for **left, right, and case batteries** directly from macOS system data.

## Features
- ‚úÖ **Check AirPods connection status**
- ‚úÖ **Display battery levels** (left earbud, right earbud, and case)
- ‚úÖ **Lightweight & fast execution**
- ‚úÖ **Fully automated, no additional setup required**
- ‚úÖ **Can be added to macOS menu bar using SwiftBar/BitBar**

## Installation
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Download the Script**
```bash
curl -O https://github.com/pratikbhavarthe/AirpodsBattery/bt_battery.sh
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Make it Executable**
```bash
chmod +x bt_battery.sh
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Move to System Path (Optional)**
To make it accessible system-wide:
```bash
sudo mv bt_battery.sh /usr/local/bin/bt_battery
```
Now you can run it with:
```bash
bt_battery
```

## Usage
Run the script:
```bash
./bt_battery.sh
```

## How It Works
1. **Finds AirPods MAC Address**: Extracts Bluetooth headphone details from `system_profiler`.
2. **Checks if AirPods are Connected**: Looks for the `Connected: Yes` field.
3. **Retrieves Battery Data**: Reads battery percentages from macOS Bluetooth preferences.
4. **Displays Status**: Outputs formatted battery information.

## Automation
### **Add to macOS Menu Bar (SwiftBar/BitBar)**
- Download [SwiftBar](https://github.com/swiftbar/SwiftBar)
- Move `bt_battery.sh` to `~/Documents/SwiftBar/`
- Rename it to `bt_battery.1m.sh` (Runs every 1 minute)
- Your AirPods battery status will appear in the macOS menu bar! üéâ
